In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data regarding Netflix directors, casts, and movie/Tv show titles to answer questions about the data.

/* Join the netflix_people table with the netflix_titles_info table*/
SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
FULL OUTER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ON "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"."show_id" = "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"."show_id";

/*How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)*/
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";
/*Answer: 8807*/

/*When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?*/
SELECT type, date_added FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER by date_added desc;
/*2021-09-25 00:00:008*/

/*List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.*/
SELECT type, title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title;

/*Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/
SELECT "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people".director, "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info".title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
INNER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ON "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"."show_id" = "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"."show_id"
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';
/*Jane Campion*/

/*What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/
SELECT title, type, release_year FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year
/*The Battle of Midway, and Prelude to War, both released in 1942*/
